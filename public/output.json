Dwags po bshad sgrub gling), also known as Dakpo Dratsang, was founded in the mid-15th century by Je Lodro Tenzin, student of Je Tsongkhapa,  founder of the Geluk sect of Buddhism. Lodro Tenzin's students eventually settled at the site which had formerly been a Kagyu monastery founded by the 9th Karmapa. 200 monks lived at Dakpo Shedrupling, while about 500 at a time were associated with the monastery but had roles travelling.

Lingrepa and his primary disciple, Tsangpa Gyare, established the Ralung Monastery soon after and it continued as a primary seat for the Drukpa Kagyu sec, as well as a center for ascetic meditation.

Samye was commissioned to be built by Tibetan Emperor Trisong Detsen in 766 in Yarlung Valley, 50 km Southeast of Lhasa. Difficulties in the construction process are said to have been quelled by rituals performed by the Nyingma Tantric master, Padmasambhava. Its campus was arranged in the shape of a Mandala, with its central temple, Tsuglakhang, representing the Buddhist holy mountain, Mount Meru. The monastic campus is surrounded by a large, circular enclosure wall with four gateway points, pointing due North, South, East, and West. Throughout its long history, it has been ruled under the Kadam, then Sakya, and lastly Geluk sects. The monastery is now restored, and continues as a key religious and pilgrimage site across sects.

                "description": "Gyume (Tib. rGyud smad) Dratsang was established in Lhasa in 1433 by Sherab Sengge, one of Tsongkhapa's primary disciples. Gyume, known as the 'Lower Tantric College' is one of two main Geluk Tantric colleges in Central Tibet. The 'Upper Tantric College' was Gyurto, and both establishments were famous for teaching with strict discipline. The neighboring Meru Dratsang is estimated to have been established between 9th-11th century. It was a large monastic compound that was converted to a Geluk monastery in the 16th century. It was affiliated with Shide Dratsang until the 17th century, at which point Meru's monks started becoming affiliated with Gyume Dratsang. More recently, Meru Dratsang has served as the center for the Tibetan Autonomous Theater Troupe. ",
